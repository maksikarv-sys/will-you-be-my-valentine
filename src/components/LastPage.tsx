       We met on our first day at uni, two strangers sharing a room and somehow i found my soulmate. 
        From that day on you've been my constant; my safe space, my laughter at 2 am while 
        talking about how shit the world is....my person.
        
      I don't think you even realise how strong you are. I've watched you work so unbelievably hard
        for the life you want, even on days when it would've been easier to give up. Your resilience
        insipires me more than you know. You have the biggest dreams, and i promise i will be right there 
        - cheering the loudest when you achieve every single one of them. 

      I hope i get to see you fall in love one day i the soft, magical way you deserve. I hope your mornings are always 
        filled with good coffee, your bag always has your favourite lip gloss, and your life filled 
        with cherry tomato pasta nights and shared bowls of nachos loaded with WHOLE jalapeños that i secretly 
        hope you dont share with your husband (kidding...maybe not) 

      Thank you for being my chosen family. Thank you for finding me that first day. I will always be grateful 
        that out of everyone in the worl...i found you, and i hope i keep finding you. 

        Love, Your darling
